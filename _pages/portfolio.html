I enjoy photography because it's a creative break from the work I do day to day. It lets me step outside, explore new
places, and document moments that feel meaningful or visually interesting. I like the process of trying to capture a
scene in just the right way—playing with angles, lighting, and framing until it feels right. It's also a way for me to
learn from others and see how different people approach the same subject with completely different styles. At the end of
the day, it's something I do because it's fun, relaxing, and gives me a reason to slow down and look at the world a
little differently.<br>
