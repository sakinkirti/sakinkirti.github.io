I was born and brought up in San Jose, CA, and went to Lynbrook High School. I started my research journey in Dr. Stefan Heller's research lab at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I performed _in-situ_ hybridizations of various genes in the chicken cochlea, working to assemble an atlas of inner ear hair cell regenerative genes.

I moved to Cleveland, OH where I attended Case Western Reserve University for my Bachelor's in Computer Science, receiving both a University Scholarship and Junior-Senior Scholarship. I was mentored by Dr. Radhika Atit, where I was a Beckman Scholar, looking for mechanistic modulators of dermal fibrosis. I performed both wet and dry lab work using tools like CellProfiler, SAM, and SqueezeNet to identify histological changes in response to inhibition of DPP4. 

I moved further east to Boston, MA to work under Dr. Patrick Ellinor at The Broad Institute. I built on computer vision methods like DINO to build unbiased feature extraction methods in the context of high-throughput imaging screens of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, I built methods to reduce inter-plate variability in high-throughput imaging screens by modifying single-cell batch correction methods. I also built software to quickly analyze videos of contracting cardioids, leading to vast improvements in processing time and accuracy compared to existing methods.

Now, I've moved back home to California to join the Bioinformatics PhD program at UCLA. I would like to build on my experiences and build probabilistic methods to model and identify causal interactions in disease biology.

I have a few hobbies; In my free time, I enjoy photography, backpacking, weightlifting, and cooking. These help keep my head on straight, tbh.

Hope you enjoy learning a bit about my experiences :)
