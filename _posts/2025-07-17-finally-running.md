Welcome to my site! Excited to get things off the ground. Hopefully I'll be able to keep this updated adding photos as I travel, adding papers whenever I publish, continuing to grow the talkmap, and teaching whenever possible. I hope that I can use the blog to write a bit about major life events and just keep a relatively public-facing journal.

I'm quite excited to start grad school this fall... even though everyone tells me that feeling will wear off relatively quickly. Something short and sweet this time!
