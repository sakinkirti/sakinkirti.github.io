## Topic
Machine learning. Recently, we have heard tons of buzz about the topic, but what is it? How can it help us solve problems? What does it mean for the future of science and technology? And how does it affect each of us? Artificial intelligence, in contrast, is the technology that can imitate human thinking behavior, including carrying out complex processes like problem-solving, planning, and learning. A particularly exciting type of artificial intelligence is machine learning. Machine learning, as the term suggests, is when a program learns from the data it is given in order to make accurate predictions or create insights about that specific dataset. So, a machine can “learn” from the past data without additional explicit programming. For example, given a chest X-ray, the algorithm would be able to tell whether this X-ray was normal or abnormal and classify the image as such. Or, given a person’s genetic information, an algorithm might design a drug that specifically binds to abnormal enzymes. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to make powerful inferences and predictions. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing the world as we know it. From healthcare to transportation, almost every industry is being influenced by these tools.
