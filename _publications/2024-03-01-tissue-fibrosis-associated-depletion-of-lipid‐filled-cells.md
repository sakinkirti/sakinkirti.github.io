## Abstract
Fibrosis is primarily described as the deposition of excessive extracellular matrix, but in many tissues it also involves a loss of lipid or lipid-filled cells. Lipid-filled cells are critical to tissue function and integrity in many tissues including the skin and lungs. Thus, loss or depletion of lipid-filled cells during fibrogenesis, has implications for tissue function. In some contexts, lipid-filled cells can impact ECM composition and stability, highlighting their importance in fibrotic transformation. Recent papers in fibrosis address this newly recognized fibrotic lipodystrophy phenomenon. Even in disparate tissues, common mechanisms are emerging to explain fibrotic lipodystrophy. These findings have implications for fibrosis in tissues composed of fibroblast and lipid-filled cell populations such as skin, lung, and liver. In this review, we will discuss the roles of lipid-containing cells, their reduction/loss during fibrotic transformation, and the mechanisms of that loss in the skin and lungs.
