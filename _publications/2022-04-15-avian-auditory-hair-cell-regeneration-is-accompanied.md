## Abstract
The avian hearing organ is the basilar papilla that, in sharp contrast to the mammalian cochlea, can regenerate sensory hair cells and thereby recover from deafness within weeks. The mechanisms that trigger, sustain and terminate the regenerative response in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we profile the changes in gene expression in the chicken basilar papilla after aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hair cell loss using RNA-sequencing. We identified changes in gene expression of a group of immune-related genes and confirmed with single-cell RNA-sequencing that these changes occur in supporting cells. In situ hybridization was used to further validate these findings. We determined that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is essential for upregulation of the damage-response genes in supporting cells during the second day after induction of hair cell loss. Four days after ototoxic damage, we identified newly regenerated, nascent auditory hair cells that express genes linked to termination of the JAK/STAT signaling response. The robust, transient expression of immune-related genes in supporting cells suggests a potential functional involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in sensory hair cell regeneration.
